===================

These codes has been written to estimate traffic signal phases from maneuver counts. We use Hidden Markov models to 
infere a phase sequence given a training sequence of maneuvers. 
For these codes to run one need HMM clasess written by Arne Leijon  at KTH university in Sweden. They will publish their code soon but 
to access their code one can send an email and request.

It is easy to read these code. In general, we generate synthetic data or use experimental data to train an initial HMM.
Then the trained HMM will be used to infer phases at the intersection. 

These codes here are very specific to oneway twoway interesections. I will publish another set of codes with more general results.
